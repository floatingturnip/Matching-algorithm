# Matching-algorithm
## How it works
This is a random matching algorithm that I use for Robochat. It takes the names in names.txt separated by a new line, and randomly matches the names into pairs

Update: Functionality also added to make secret santa matches 

## Requires:
A names.txt file with the names of the people to be matched

## Background
The summer of second year Engineering Physics is considered our "Robot Summer" and is usually the term where everyone in the cohort gets to know each other a lot more. However, due to COVID-19, in the summer of 2020, Robot Summer had to be moved online and me and many of my classmates felt that we were missing out on bonding with our cohort so I decided to initialize a causal chatting program to allow our classmates to feel connected

## What is Robochat?
Robochat is a program where students in my cohort can sign up each week to be randomly matched with other classmates and arrange a time together to have a casual video call conversation
