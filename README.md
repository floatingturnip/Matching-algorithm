# Matching-algorithm
## How it works
This is a random matching algorithm that I use for Robochat. It takes the names in names.txt separated by a new line, 
and randomly matches the names into pairs

I also modified it to incorporate functionality to make secret santa matches 

## Requires:
A names.txt file with the names of the people to be matched

## How to use:
have a names.txt file with all the participants' names on a separate line. Open the desired .m file on MATLAB and hit run. Matches will be generated in a new .txt file according to the designated name

## Background
The summer of second year Engineering Physics is considered our "Robot Summer" and is usually the term where everyone 
in the cohort gets to know each other a lot more. However, due to COVID-19, in the summer of 2020, Robot Summer had 
to be moved online and me and many of my classmates felt that we were missing out on bonding with our cohort so I 
decided to initialize a causal chatting program to allow our classmates to feel connected

## What is Robochat?
Robochat is a program where students in my cohort can sign up each week to be randomly matched with other classmates 
and arrange a time together to have a casual video call conversation

## Future plans
I am currently working on shifting the implementation to python. Once the python implementations are complete, 
I hope to improve the matching algorithm for secret santa
